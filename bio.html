					<h3 class="major">Wild Aura</h3>
					<p>Born Daniel Falco, Wild Aura was immediately pushed into the industry by modeling as a baby for
						commercials and posters. When he turned five, he starred in his first play as “Buckwheat” <i>in
							The
							Little Rascals</i>. He then continued acting starring as “Aladdin” in <i>Aladdin</i> and
						“Mike TV”
						in
						<i>Charlie & The Chocolate Factory</i>. In addition, at the age of eight, he was in <i>South
							Pacific</i>,
						where he only spoke and sang in French. He continued acting until age sixteen when his career in
						music truly began.
					</p>

					<p>Wild Aura was a contestant on <i>American Idol</i> and was also in the top 32 of <i>The X
							Factor</i>
						(season 2)
						where he received praise from Simon Cowell, Britney Spears, Demi Lovato & LA Reid in his
						audition. He was later eliminated in the same round as Camila Cabello, Normani & the other girls
						of Fifth Harmony. After being rejected, he was picked up by Smashpop Records and was put into a
						boyband named “Kik-it” with notable bandmates Colin Jamieson and Andrew Marshall. The band was
						set up for success, as they toured all over New England and opened for artists such as Ke$ha,
						Big Time Rush, Victoria Justice & Mike Posner. “Kik-it” created a fan base that put them in
						<i>Popstar Magazine</i> twice. Then, in 2015, the band broke up and was dropped from the label.
						Wild
						Aura took a hiatus to focus on his mental health. During his hiatus, Wila Aura struggled with a
						near death eating disorder, requiring him to seek professional help and is now in recovery.
					</p>

					<p>He then went to make his debut as a solo artist by auditioning for <i>American Idol</i> season
						4
						reboot on ABC. Wild Aura was quickly eliminated in the series, sending him into a downward
						spiral. After getting the right help, he wrote his debut album “Confessions Of A Fallen Star” in
						30 days while in treatment. He never had any experience writing music but he found it as a way
						to cope and heal. Wild Aura is now working on his sophomore album, “Survivor,” which is a
						sixteen track album scheduled to be released in December 2022. Wild Aura has recently released
						new music from these albums, so make sure to stay tuned and up to speed with this diamond in the
						rough!</p>
